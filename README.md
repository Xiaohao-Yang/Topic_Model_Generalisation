# Topic Model Generalisation
Neural topic model generalisation in terms of document representation.

# Requirements
```python
torch: 2.2.1+cu121
torchmetrics: 1.3.2
numpy: 1.24.1
scipy: 1.12.0
scikit-learn: 1.4.1.post1
gensim: 4.3.2
pot: 0.9.3

# Datasets
We store our pre-processed datasets in .mat files, which can be loaded as dictionaries using scipy.io.loadmat().

The datasets/dictionaries have the following common attributes/keys:
wordsTrain, labelsTrain: bag-of-words (BOW) of training documents, and their labels. 
wordsTest, labelsTest: BOW of testing documents, and their labels.
